# Control-LED-strip-with-Arduino-Ultrasonic-sensor-
In this mini-project, we will be combining an ultrasonic distance sensor and an addressable LED strip. The goal is to trigger the LED strip when a person is passing by in a certain distance. The indicator will be effective between a minimum and maximum distance.
